Not too many tokens spent on the explanation of each category, since I think LLM is smart enough


We originally had category descriptions generated by the LLM itself, but that can lead to tunnel vision — it kind of overthinks its own logic.


giving it the raw category codes along with their full names.


But give it multiple examples: wrote a code to extract as many distinct subjects on 10 examples

Set of examples with correct answers: first the summary, than the result

Summary: We present the results of a broad, systematic study of heavy-ion induced fission mass distributions for every even-Z compound nucleus ($Z_\mathrm{CN}$) from $^{144}$Gd to $^{212}$Th. We find systematic evidence of shell-driven structure in every fission mass distribution. The change in shape of the mass distributions with $Z_\mathrm{CN}$ is consistent with the results of quantitative simultaneous fitting in mass and total kinetic energy, demonstrating that fragment proton shell gaps at $Z_\mathrm{FF} = 34, 36$ and $Z_\mathrm{FF} = 44, 46$ are \textit{both} major drivers of fission mass distributions below the actinide region. The mass distributions show enhanced yields at mass symmetry for values of $Z_\mathrm{CN}$ equal to two times these favoured $Z_\mathrm{FF}$ values. Thus, the same shell gaps that are drivers of mass-asymmetric fission also affect mass distributions at and near mass-symmetry. For all systems a second, more mass-asymmetric, fission mode is required to fit the fission mass distributions. If driven by a single shell gap, it appears to be in the light fragment around $Z_\mathrm{FF} = 28, 30$.

Summary: Space-Time Projection (STP) is introduced as a data-driven forecasting approach for high-dimensional and time-resolved data. The method computes extended space-time proper orthogonal modes from training data spanning a prediction horizon comprising both hindcast and forecast intervals. Forecasts are then generated by projecting the hindcast portion of these modes onto new data, simultaneously leveraging their orthogonality and optimal correlation with the forecast extension. Rooted in Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) theory, dimensionality reduction and time-delay embedding are intrinsic to the approach. For a given ensemble and fixed prediction horizon, the only tunable parameter is the truncation rank--no additional hyperparameters are required. The hindcast accuracy serves as a reliable indicator for short-term forecast accuracy and establishes a lower bound on forecast errors. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated using two datasets: transient, highly anisotropic simulations of supernova explosions in a turbulent interstellar medium, and experimental velocity fields of a turbulent high-subsonic engineering flow. In a comparative study with standard Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks--acknowledging that alternative architectures or training strategies may yield different outcomes--the method consistently provided more accurate forecasts.

Summary: Genome annotation is essential for understanding the functional elements within genomes. While automated methods are indispensable for processing large-scale genomic data, they often face challenges in accurately predicting gene structures and functions. Consequently, manual curation by domain experts remains crucial for validating and refining these predictions. These combined outcomes from automated tools and manual curation highlight the importance of integrating human expertise with AI capabilities to improve both the accuracy and efficiency of genome annotation. However, the manual curation process is inherently labor-intensive and time-consuming, making it difficult to scale for large datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a conceptual framework, Human-AI Collaborative Genome Annotation (HAICoGA), which leverages the synergistic partnership between humans and artificial intelligence to enhance human capabilities and accelerate the genome annotation process. Additionally, we explore the potential of integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into this framework to support and augment specific tasks. Finally, we discuss emerging challenges and outline open research questions to guide further exploration in this area.

Summary:
The high-entropy concept was applied to the synthesis of transition-metal antimonides, M1-xPtxSb (M = equimolar Ru, Rh, Pd, and Ir). High-entropy antimonide samples crystallized in a pseudo-hexagonal NiAs-type crystal structure with a P63/mmc space group were successfully synthesized through a conventional solid-state reaction and subsequent quenching. A detailed investigation of the composition and equilibration conditions confirmed the reversible phase transition between a multi-phase state at low temperature and an entropy-driven single-phase solid solution at high temperatures. Electrical resistivity, magnetization, and heat capacity measurements of single-phase M1-xPtxSb (x = 0.2) samples revealed a bulk superconducting transition at 2.15(2) K. This study demonstrates that the high-entropy concept provides numerous opportunities for the discovery of new functional materials such as superconductors.

Summary: Estimating the mode of a unimodal distribution is a classical problem in statistics. Although there are several approaches for point-estimation of mode in the literature, very little has been explored about the interval-estimation of mode. Our work proposes a collection of novel methods of obtaining finite sample valid confidence set of the mode of a unimodal distribution. We analyze the behaviour of the width of the proposed confidence sets under some regularity assumptions of the density about the mode and show that the width of these confidence sets shrink to zero near optimally. Simply put, we show that it is possible to build finite sample valid confidence sets for the mode that shrink to a singleton as sample size increases. We support the theoretical results by showing the performance of the proposed methods on some synthetic data-sets. We believe that our confidence sets can be improved both in construction and in terms of rate.

Summary:
In this paper, we study the dispersion-managed nonlinear Schr\"odinger (DM-NLS) equation $$ i\partial_t u(t,x)+\gamma(t)\Delta u(t,x)=|u(t,x)|^{\frac4d}u(t,x),\quad x\in\R^d, $$ and the nonlinearity-managed NLS (NM-NLS) equation: $$ i\partial_t u(t,x)+\Delta u(t,x)=\gamma(t)|u(t,x)|^{\frac4d}u(t,x), \quad x\in\R^d, $$ where $\gamma(t)$ is a periodic function which is equal to $-1$ when $t\in (0,1]$ and is equal to $1$ when $t\in (1,2]$. The two models share the feature that the focusing and defocusing effects convert periodically. For the classical focusing NLS, it is known that the initial data $$ u_0(x)=T^{-\frac{d}{2}}\fe^{i\frac{|x|^2}{4T} -i\frac{\omega^2}{T}}Q_\omega\left(\frac{x}{T}\right) $$ leads to a blowup solution $$(T-t)^{-\frac{d}{2}}\fe^{i\frac{|x|^2}{4(T-t)} -i\frac{\omega^2}{T-t}}Q_\omega\left(\frac{x}{T-t}\right), $$ so when $T\leq1$, this is also a blowup solution for DM-NLS and NM-NLS which blows up in the first focusing layer.   For DM-NLS, we prove that when $T>1$, the initial data $u_0$ above does not lead to a finite-time blowup and the corresponding solution is globally well-posed. For NM-NLS, we prove the global well-posedness for $T\in(1,2)$ and we construct solution that can blow up at any focusing layer. The theoretical studies are complemented by extensive numerical explorations towards understanding the stabilization effects in the two models and addressing their difference.

Summary: Smart contracts are fundamental pillars of the blockchain, playing a crucial role in facilitating various business transactions. However, these smart contracts are vulnerable to exploitable bugs that can lead to substantial monetary losses. A recent study reveals that over 80% of these exploitable bugs, which are primarily functional bugs, can evade the detection of current tools. The primary issue is the significant gap between understanding the high-level logic of the business model and checking the low-level implementations in smart contracts. Furthermore, identifying deeply rooted functional bugs in smart contracts requires the automated generation of effective detection oracles based on various bug features. To address these challenges, we design and implement PROMFUZZ, an automated and scalable system to detect functional bugs, in smart contracts. In PROMFUZZ, we first propose a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-driven analysis framework, which leverages a dual-agent prompt engineering strategy to pinpoint potentially vulnerable functions for further scrutiny. We then implement a dual-stage coupling approach, which focuses on generating invariant checkers that leverage logic information extracted from potentially vulnerable functions. Finally, we design a bug-oriented fuzzing engine, which maps the logical information from the high-level business model to the low-level smart contract implementations, and performs the bug-oriented fuzzing on targeted functions. We compare PROMFUZZ with multiple state-of-the-art methods. The results show that PROMFUZZ achieves 86.96% recall and 93.02% F1-score in detecting functional bugs, marking at least a 50% improvement in both metrics over state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we perform an in-depth analysis on real-world DeFi projects and detect 30 zero-day bugs. Up to now, 24 zero-day bugs have been assigned CVE IDs.

Summary: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), such as the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), are widely studied as candidates for near-term quantum advantage. Recent work has shown that training VQAs is NP-hard in general. In this paper, we present a conditional result suggesting that the training of VQAs is undecidable, even in idealized, noiseless settings. We reduce the decision version of the digitized VQA training problem-where circuit parameters are drawn from a discrete set-to the question of whether a universal Diophantine equation (UDE) has a root. This reduction relies on encoding the UDE into the structure of a variational quantum circuit via the matrix exponentials. The central step involves establishing a correspondence between the objective function of the VQA and a known UDE of 58 variables and degree 4. Our main result is conditional on a natural conjecture: that a certain system of structured complex polynomial equations-arising from the inner product of a VQA circuit output and a fixed observable-has at least one solution. We argue this conjecture is plausible based on dimension-counting arguments (degrees of freedom in the Hamiltonians, state vector, and observable), and the generic solvability of such systems in algebraic geometry over the complex numbers. Under this assumption, we suggest that deciding whether a digitized VQA achieves a given energy threshold is undecidable. This links the limitations of variational quantum algorithms to foundational questions in mathematics and logic, extending the known landscape of quantum computational hardness to include uncomputability.

Summary: We report on the 2024 September 9 sustained gamma ray emission (SGRE) event observed by the Large Area Telescope onboard the Fermi satellite. The event was associated with a backside solar eruption observed by multiple spacecraft such as the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO), Parker Solar Probe (PSP), Solar Orbiter (SolO), Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), Wind, and GOES, and by ground based radio telescopes. SolO Spectrometer Telescope for Imaging X rays (STIX) imaged an intense flare, which occurred about 41 deg behind the east limb, from heliographic coordinates S13E131. Forward modeling of the CME flux rope revealed that it impulsively accelerated (3.54 km s^{-2}) to attain a peak speed of 2162 km s^{-1}. SolO energetic particle detectors (EPD) observed protons up to about 1 GeV from the extended shock and electrons that produced a complex type II burst and possibly type III bursts. The durations of SGRE and type II burst are consistent with the linear relation between these quantities obtained from longer duration (exceeding 3 hours) SGRE events. All these observations are consistent with an extended shock surrounding the CME flux rope, which is the likely source of high energy protons required for the SGRE event. We compare this event with six other BTL SGRE eruptions and find that they are all consistent with energetic shock driving CMEs. We also find a significant east west asymmetry in the BTL source locations.

Measurements of hadronic final states in $e^{+}e^{-}$ collisions at centre-of-mass (CM) energies below the Z peak can notably extend the FCC-ee physics reach in terms of precision quantum chromodynamics (QCD) studies. Hadronic final states can be studied over a range of hadronic energies $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{had}} \approx 20\mbox{--}80\,\mathrm{GeV}$ by exploiting events with hard initial- and final-state QED radiation (ISR/FSR) during the high-luminosity Z-pole run, as well as in dedicated short (about one month long) $e^{+}e^{-}$ runs at CM energies $\sqrt{s} \approx 40\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and $60\,\mathrm{GeV}$. Using realistic estimates and fast detector simulations, we show that data samples of about $10^{9}$ hadronic events can be collected at the FCC-ee at each of the low-CM-energy points. Such datasets can be exploited in a variety of precision QCD measurements, including studies of light-, heavy-quark and gluon jet properties, hadronic event shapes, fragmentation functions, and nonperturbative dynamics. This will offer valuable insights into strong interaction physics, complementing data from nominal FCC-ee runs at higher center-of-mass energies, $\sqrt{s} \approx 91, 160, 240,$ and $365\,\mathrm{GeV}$.

Summary:
Lithium-ion batteries have become an indispensable part of human industrial production and daily life. For the safe use, management and maintenance of lithium-ion batteries, the state of health (SOH) of lithium-ion batteries is an important indicator so that the SOH estimation is of significant practical value. In order to accurately predict SOH, this paper proposes a fusion prediction model which combines particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, bi-directional long-short time memory network (BiLSTM) and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) algorithm. In the proposed prediction model, indirect health indicators (HIs), which characterize battery degradation, are obtained with the help of incremental capacity analysis (ICA), and is fed into BiLSTM to extract time-series features, whose parameters are optimized by employing PSO algorithm. On this basis, the AdaBoost algorithm is applied to reduce the risk of overfitting the PSO-BiLSTM model. The study based on lithium-ion battery data from Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering (CALCE) shows that the PSO-BiLSTM-AdaBoost model has higher accuracy, better robustness, and generalization ability.
