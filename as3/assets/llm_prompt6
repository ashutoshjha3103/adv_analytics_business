{"aid": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24234v1", "title": "Beyond Gaussian Assumptions: A Nonlinear Generalization of Linear\n  Inverse Modeling", "summary": "The Linear Inverse Model (LIM) is a class of data-driven methods that\nconstruct approximate linear stochastic models to represent complex\nobservational data. The stochastic forcing can be modeled using either Gaussian\nwhite noise or Ornstein-Uhlenbeck colored noise; the corresponding models are\ncalled White-LIM and Colored-LIM, respectively. Although LIMs are widely\napplied in climate sciences, they inherently approximate observed distributions\nas Gaussian, limiting their ability to capture asymmetries.\n  In this study, we extend LIMs to incorporate nonlinear dynamics, introducing\nWhite-nLIM and Colored-nLIM which allow for a more flexible and accurate\nrepresentation of complex dynamics from observations. The proposed methods not\nonly account for the nonlinear nature of the underlying system but also\neffectively capture the skewness of the observed distribution. Moreover, we\napply these methods to a lower-dimensional representation of ENSO and\ndemonstrate that both White-nLIM and Colored-nLIM successfully capture its\nnonlinear characteristic."}

{"aid": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23679v1", "title": "The Devil is in the Distributions: Explicit Modeling of Scene Content is\n  Key in Zero-Shot Video Captioning", "summary": "Zero-shot video captioning requires that a model generate high-quality\ncaptions without human-annotated video-text pairs for training.\nState-of-the-art approaches to the problem leverage CLIP to extract\nvisual-relevant textual prompts to guide language models in generating\ncaptions. These methods tend to focus on one key aspect of the scene and build\na caption that ignores the rest of the visual input. To address this issue, and\ngenerate more accurate and complete captions, we propose a novel progressive\nmulti-granularity textual prompting strategy for zero-shot video captioning.\nOur approach constructs three distinct memory banks, encompassing noun phrases,\nscene graphs of noun phrases, and entire sentences. Moreover, we introduce a\ncategory-aware retrieval mechanism that models the distribution of natural\nlanguage surrounding the specific topics in question. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method with 5.7%, 16.2%, and 3.4%\nimprovements in terms of the main metric CIDEr on MSR-VTT, MSVD, and VATEX\nbenchmarks compared to existing state-of-the-art."}

{"aid": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23720v1", "title": "On an approach to canonicalizing elliptic Feynman integrals", "summary": "We present a systematic method for the construction of canonical bases for\nunivariate elliptic Feynman integrals with multiple kinematic scales, which\nfrequently arise in phenomenologically relevant scattering processes. The\nconstruction is performed in the Legendre normal form of elliptic curves, where\nthe geometric propoerties of the curves are simple and explicit and further\nkinemtic singularities are present as marked points. The canonical bases are\nconstructed using Abelian differentials of three kinds with a universal linear\ntransformation. The bases constructed in the normal form can be mapped to\ngeneric integral families via an appropriate M\\\"obius transformation. As a\ndemonstration, we discuss the application of our method to several concrete\nexamples, where we show that the $\\varepsilon$-factorization of sub-sector\ndependence can also be simply done. Our method can be readily applied to more\ncomplicated integral families straightforwardly."}

{"aid": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23786v1", "title": "MGD-SAM2: Multi-view Guided Detail-enhanced Segment Anything Model 2 for\n  High-Resolution Class-agnostic Segmentation", "summary": "Segment Anything Models (SAMs), as vision foundation models, have\ndemonstrated remarkable performance across various image analysis tasks.\nDespite their strong generalization capabilities, SAMs encounter challenges in\nfine-grained detail segmentation for high-resolution class-independent\nsegmentation (HRCS), due to the limitations in the direct processing of\nhigh-resolution inputs and low-resolution mask predictions, and the reliance on\naccurate manual prompts. To address these limitations, we propose MGD-SAM2\nwhich integrates SAM2 with multi-view feature interaction between a global\nimage and local patches to achieve precise segmentation. MGD-SAM2 incorporates\nthe pre-trained SAM2 with four novel modules: the Multi-view Perception Adapter\n(MPAdapter), the Multi-view Complementary Enhancement Module (MCEM), the\nHierarchical Multi-view Interaction Module (HMIM), and the Detail Refinement\nModule (DRM). Specifically, we first introduce MPAdapter to adapt the SAM2\nencoder for enhanced extraction of local details and global semantics in HRCS\nimages. Then, MCEM and HMIM are proposed to further exploit local texture and\nglobal context by aggregating multi-view features within and across\nmulti-scales. Finally, DRM is designed to generate gradually restored\nhigh-resolution mask predictions, compensating for the loss of fine-grained\ndetails resulting from directly upsampling the low-resolution prediction maps.\nExperimental results demonstrate the superior performance and strong\ngeneralization of our model on multiple high-resolution and normal-resolution\ndatasets. Code will be available at https://github.com/sevenshr/MGD-SAM2."}

{"aid": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23798v1", "title": "Adaptive Layer-skipping in Pre-trained LLMs", "summary": "Various layer-skipping methods have been proposed to accelerate token\ngeneration in large language models (LLMs). However, they have overlooked a\nfundamental question: How do computational demands vary across the generation\nof different tokens? In this work, we introduce FlexiDepth, a method that\ndynamically adjusts the number of Transformer layers used in text generation.\nBy incorporating a plug-in router and adapter, FlexiDepth enables adaptive\nlayer-skipping in LLMs without modifying their original parameters. Introducing\nFlexiDepth to Llama-3-8B model achieves layer skipping of 8 layers out of 32,\nand meanwhile maintains the full 100\\% benchmark performance. Experimental\nresults with FlexiDepth demonstrate that computational demands in LLMs\nsignificantly vary based on token type. Specifically, generating repetitive\ntokens or fixed phrases requires fewer layers, whereas producing tokens\ninvolving computation or high uncertainty requires more layers. Interestingly,\nthis adaptive allocation pattern aligns with human intuition. To advance\nresearch in this area, we open sourced FlexiDepth and a dataset documenting\nFlexiDepth's layer allocation patterns for future exploration."}

{"aid": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24225v1", "title": "Compressible N-phase fluid mixture models", "summary": "Fluid mixture models are essential for describing a wide range of physical\nphenomena, including wave dynamics and spinodal decomposition. However, there\nis a lack of consensus in the modeling of compressible mixtures, with limited\nconnections between different classes of models. On the one hand, existing\ncompressible two-phase flow models accurately describe wave dynamics, but do\nnot incorporate phase separation mechanisms. On the other hand, phase-field\ntechnology in fluid dynamics consists of models incorporating spinodal\ndecomposition, however, a general phase-field theory for compressible mixtures\nremains largely undeveloped.\n  In this paper, we take an initial step toward bridging the gap between\ncompressible two-phase flow models and phase-field models by developing a\ntheory for compressible, isothermal N-phase mixtures. Our theory establishes a\nsystem of reduced complexity by formulating N mass balance laws alongside a\nsingle momentum balance law, thereby naturally extending the Navier-Stokes\nKorteweg model to N-phases and providing the Navier-Stokes\nCahn-Hilliard/Allen-Cahn model for compressible mixtures. Key aspects of the\nframework include its grounding in continuum mixture theory and its\npreservation of thermodynamic consistency despite its reduced complexity."}
